          <h1 id="heading">How to Create Strong Passwords</h1>
        <p>
Creating strong and secure passwords is the first step into securing your accounts, devices, and other important data that may be stored in a digital sense. In case someone has malicious intent or hopes to steal data, a good password can be vital in digital protection.
<br>
There are a few common passwords that are extremely easy to guess for attackers. For example, passwords such as “12345” or “qwerty” are passwords that you should avoid. Any passwords that include personal information such as your name or birthday could also be easily guessed. This information can be easily found on social media sites and public platforms that are available to anyone. These facts are likely the first things that attackers will try to exploit as a password. 
<br> <br>
Some attacks that may be used include brute force and dictionary attacks. Brute force attacks are essentially testing characters over and over to try and match a password. Dictionary attacks use more of a computational method of testing words in a dictionary. Knowing how these attacks play out can help to find ways of making strong passwords.
<br> <br>
The strongest passwords are made with letters, numbers, and symbols including both upper and lower case letters. It’s smart to never share passwords with anyone, even if the person is trusted. Also never write down passwords as physical copies can be found and compromised. You should also change your passwords every few months to make sure that your accounts stay protected. 
<br> <br>
Authentication is also vital to maintain security. Multi-step authentication processes can protect your accounts even if your password is uncovered.
